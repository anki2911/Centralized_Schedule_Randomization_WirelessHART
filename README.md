# Centralized_Schedule_Randomization_WirelessHART

Thhis repository contains codebase for the implementation of "SlotSwapper : A Schedule Randomization Protocol for Real-Time WirelessHART Networks" (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3378408.3378413) accepted in ACM Real-Time Networks 2019 
and 
"A Schedule Randomization Policy to Mitigate Timing Attacks in WirelessHART Networks" (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11241-020-09354-z) accepted in Springer Real-Time Systems, Journal, 2020. 

The main schedule randomization code is available at Multi_Channel_Random.py inside Codes/RTSS_With_Code/Codes/ folder.
